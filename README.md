# Github Download Tracker
Track your github releases downloads count easily.

# Description
Github doesn't have a UI to track download counts for releases, so if you want to track your download counts per day, this app solves the problem easily by running a scheduled task once per day to record the download count for your releases.

It also provides you with graphs and helpful information for your repositories.
